Steal will begin to recharge immediately after activation, but is only available again after the stolen item is used.\n\nEach enemy in the game has a small pool of possible items to steal.[2] For example, a character may steal an egg from a moa and use it as a healing item, or steal feathers from it and use them to blind enemies. In PvP the stolen items are profession-specific, for example the thief can get a rifle or a hammer from a warrior, while an elementalist might have a scepter or a lava rock.\n\nStolen items from players are not actually taken from them; the thief just gains access to the associated steal skill." forKey:@"specialAbilitiesDescription"];

Activating one of these virtues will disable its passive effect until that ability recharges once again. Each virtue has its own recharge so may be used independently of the others.\n\nThe benefits of the same virtues do not stack.

Upon leaving Death Shroud, there is a 10-second cooldown before it can be used again.\n\nLife force is the necromancers resource that fuels Death Shroud. Life force is gained when foes die nearby and through certain skills. Death Shroud depletes life force and ends when it reaches zero. Life force capacity is increased by attribute Hunger.

A pet has a family, such as bear, which determines most of their skills and its general attributes. Its species, such as a polar bear or a brown bear, determines a unique skill. Its type; aquatic, terrestrial or amphibious, determines which environments the pet is able to operate in.\n\nThe ranger has limited control over the actions of their pet; they can set the aggressiveness of the pet and activate a skill, otherwise a pet's action is automatically controled and based on what the ranger does in combat.

This improvement can be anything from doing more damage, adding additional conditions, increasing condition duration, or increasing skill duration. The burst skill does not take a skill slot and is automatically chosen according to the two-handed weapon equiped or, in case of dual-wielding, the weapon equipped in the main hand.\n\nAdrenaline is a resource unique to the warrior profession.

There are four attunement skills in total, representing the elements of earth, fire, air and water. Because they are special skills, they are located separately just above the skill bar. These skills are assigned buttons F1 to F4 on the keyboard (by default).\n\nActivating an attunement changes the first five skills on the skill bar, releases an immediate area of effect around the elementalist and from there provides the character with a passive, ongoing effect so long as they are attuned to that element. Elementalists' hands also become enveloped by an aura which identifies that character's attunement.\n\nAttunements activate instantly and can be activated mid-cast. When one is activated, the previous attunement recharges for 15 seconds, while the other two recharge for 1 second. Both of these recharges can be reduced by the Intelligence attribute.\n\nElementalists do not have a normal state of activity, and unless directed by an environmental weapon, they are always attuned to an element in any given situation." forKey:@"specialAbilitiesDescription"];

The most important of these is the Arcane Council, which is, in theory, a collection of wise asura who enforce the laws of the people. In reality, this group consists of those who are not wise enough to get out of the task, as most asura would rather be pursuing their own creative agendas as opposed to dealing with internal squabbling and bureaucratic rivalries.\n\nRata Sum is also the home of the colleges of the asura people: the Colleges of Statics, Dynamics, and Synergetics. Each has a major complex where promising students, apprentices, and journeymen without their own labs can work, advance their knowledge, and attract better-established mentors. Each of the colleges has its own approach to the Eternal Alchemy. Those of Statics tend to think of the world in lines of force and supportâ€”as a fixed stateâ€”and seek to learn from the lost lessons of the past. Those of Dynamics perceive the world in an active, ever-changing state, and feel that any experiment you can walk away from is a success. Lastly, those of Synergetics think in terms of the connections between things, in the space between beats. They are the most mystic and theoretical of their people.\n\nRata Sum is the central hub, but the asura have spread their laboratories and research facilities throughout the Tarnished Coast. The personalized nature of creation and the drive to prove themselves the best at their craft often send asuran masters and their krewes into the hinterlands, away from prying eyes and potential competitors. Often, this means that labs are built in particularly remote or dangerous areas. Should a lab be destroyed or its workers slain, new discoveries may be completely lost.

Following the Exodus the human Kingdom of Orr assumed stewardship of the city, watching over it in anticipation of the day when the gods would return. However their protection of the city would come to a catastrophic end in an event that became known as the Cataclysm.\n\nDuring the Guild Wars, open fighting in the streets of Arah had led to hostilities between the three human nations of Tyria. As such, the nations did not unite against the threat of the charr invasion, each choosing to stand alone. In 1070 AE the Searing shattered Ascalon's defenses and allowed the invading charr to push into Orrian territory, driven by the orders of their titan gods to destroy Arah. In 1071 AE, before they could raze the city, Vizier Khilbron, the adviser to King Reza, used magic buried in a vault deep beneath Arah and brought about the Cataclysm, destroying the charr invasion and the Kingdom of Orr in an instant. Arah sank beneath the waves of the Bay of Sirens (later renamed the Sea of Sorrows to reflect this) with the rest of the peninsula and was thought lost, fulfilling the wish of the god Abaddon.\n\nHowever, nearly 150 years after the destruction of Orr, a new power stirred in the sunken ruins of Arah. The deathless dragon Zhaitan woke from an ancient slumber and raised the drowned Kingdom to the surface once again. The ruins of Arah are now his lair and the main base of operations for the undead legions and fleets that maintain a stranglehold on Tyria's sea routes." forKey:@"Description"];
